## Backend configuration

The backend uses environment variables. Do NOT commit secrets.

- Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and fill values (e.g. `MONGO_URI`).
- `backend/.env` is ignored by git (added to repository `.gitignore`).
- If you accidentally committed credentials, rotate them immediately and remove the file from history.
